### Hi there, I'm [Rushikesh Konapure](https://rishikonapure.medium.com/) üëã

I am a Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Cloud Enthusiast. I like to explore new things, enhancing and expanding my knowledge each and every day! I like to play with data, execute analytical experiments, to create a positive impact across various domains and industries.  Apart from that I write articles (on Machine Learning and Data Science) and contributing to open source.


- üíª Currently doing #100daysofmlcode challenge and posting daily progress on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mlwithrish/) and [Github](https://github.com/rishikonapure/-100daysofmlcode). The aim of this project is to learn machine learning algorithms from scratch.
- üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Currently growing my skillset in [Machine Learning](https://github.com/rishikonapure/-100daysofmlcode) and [Data Science](https://github.com/rishikonapure/-100daysofmlcode).


 **I am open to**:

- any collobration work,
- machine learning projects(development or research),
- research internships.


**Recent Update**:
- **Jan 2020**: Our paper [Text Data Analysis for Advertisement Recommendation System Using Multi-label Classification of Machine Learning](http://matjournals.in/index.php/JoDMM/article/view/4521) has been published in Journal of Data Mining and Management ([MAT Journals](http://matjournals.com/Journal-of-Data-Mining-and-Management.html)).
